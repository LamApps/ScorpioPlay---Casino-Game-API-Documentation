## 🧩 What Is a Bonus Call?

The **Bonus Call** feature is crafted to elevate player engagement by allowing temporary bonuses to be added to ongoing games, **excluding live games**.  

This functionality enables agents to offer appealing bonuses to players, thereby enhancing their gaming experience and encouraging continued play.  

Crucially, these bonuses are applied in a manner that does **not affect the agents' overall points balance**, ensuring they can maintain their resources while still providing attractive incentives.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Process

The Bonus Call feature can be activated for a specific user within a particular game.  

To begin:
1. Identify online users currently engaged in games.  
   - You can find these users in the **[Users/Game Connections]** page of our back office.  
   - Or by calling the endpoint:  
     ```
     /v4/game/online-games
     ```
2. Specify the **bonus amount** you wish to allocate to the players.  
3. (Optional) Include a **memo** for additional information.  

Once the Bonus Call is initiated:
- The player receives the bonus amount over several spins or free spins.  
- Regardless of the number of spins, the total bonus amount will be credited to the player's account.  
- When activated, the bonus amount is temporarily deducted from the agent’s points and credited to the user’s balance.  
- If the user wins, the winning amount is paid out to the user, and the bonus amount is later returned to the agent’s points.

✅ This ensures the agent’s total points remain **unaffected** by the bonus call process.

## 🧾 Eligibility

Bonus calls can be applied **only** to games where the `call_enable` flag is set to `true` in the in-progress game list.

---

## 📊 Impact on RTP

The betting amount during a bonus call is included in the **RTP (Return to Player)** calculations, ensuring that the overall RTP remains accurate and unaffected by bonus call transactions.

---

## 💰 Transaction Types

If a user wins through a bonus call, a **BonusCall(32)** transaction is generated instead of the usual **Win(2)** transaction.

---

## 🔗 Seamless Mode

In **Seamless Mode**, a `bonus call ID` is sent to the betting/winning callback.  
This ID is returned as the field `call_id`, with:
- `0` indicating a general transaction.

---

## 📡 Status Monitoring

The current status of a bonus call can be checked using the `call_status` field in the in-progress game list.  
This field provides detailed information about the current bonus call state.

| Code | Value     | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 0    | Init       | Initialized |
| 1    | Running    | In Progress |
| 2    | Complete   | Completed   |
| 3    | Cancel     | Canceled    |
